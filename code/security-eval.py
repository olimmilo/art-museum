#finds the equations and limits for the moving walls


#finds the intersection for camera views


#finds the coverage if the camera view is on the same wall/wall plane


#finds the coverage is the camera view falls upon more than one wall plane


#checks that none of the camera side views lie on the same plane as a wall, and if they do, then includes that coverage


#sums the coverage of all three sides of the camera


#sums the coverage of both cameras


#divides sumative coverage by all surface on which paintings can be hung and multiplies by 100 to give percent
